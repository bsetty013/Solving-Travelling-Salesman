# Solving-Travelling-Salesman
This was a project I undertook during the fourth year of my degree, where I had to use the Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO) algorithm to find solutions to the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP). I had to conduct experiments to assess the optimal parameters on the PSO algorithm aswell as evaluate the quality of the solutions found. I executed the PSO algorithm on five TSP problems which are on the text files stored in thsi repository. To explore the code and the results you can open evolutioanry_computation_project.pynb and excute the notebook.
